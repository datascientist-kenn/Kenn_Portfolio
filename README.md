#	Loan Default Prediction (Python and R)
•Towards ensuring that the decision to provide an individual or borrower with credit is taken off the human bias, my team and I created a loan default prediction model for a credit facility in Nigeria. 
• This model takes into consideration the borrower’s bank balances and investments to create an alternative credit score framework together with other demographic information to analyze and give an accurate prediction of the likelihood of repaying the intended loan. 
• This project trained about 8 models and uses the Random Forest Classifier algorithm and has been tested to have a prediction accuracy of 0.93936420 (93.9%) and a predicted probability score of 0.97618 (97.6%).
