#	[Loan Default Prediction (Python and R)](https://github.com/datascientist-kenn/Loan_Credit_Score_Framework.git)
- Towards ensuring that the decision to provide an individual or borrower with credit is taken off the human bias, my team and I created a loan default prediction model for a credit facility in Nigeria. 
- This model takes into consideration the borrowerâ€™s bank balances and investments to create an alternative credit score framework together with other demographic information to analyze and give an accurate prediction of the likelihood of repaying the intended loan. 
- This project trained about 8 models and uses the Random Forest Classifier algorithm and has been tested to have a prediction accuracy of 0.93936420 (93.9%) and a predicted probability score of 0.97618 (97.6%). 


#	[Coronavirus Tracker with Python-Dash and Voila Dashboard (Not deployed)](https://github.com/datascientist-kenn/COVID19-Dashboard.git) 
- This project, which is for personal analysis, helps me eliminate all the noise and fake news about the number of cases of the Coronavirus pandemic. 
- This is so that, I can keep track of the actual numbers using a data pipeline from the John Hopkins University live data. 
- Three Models are also built here to try to predict the future behavior of the virus and possibly predict the end of it.

- **Voila Dashboard for COVID19 with Cases and Prediction Visualization** 
- Make sure all the libraries at the beginning of the code are installed with pip on your machine. 
- In command prompt, type the following command to load the dashboard `voila covid19_lm_for_voila.ipynb --template=material --theme=dark` 
- The project is still subject to modifications, contributions are very welcomed. The code also includes interactive visualisations using Plotly and IPython Widgets in JupyterLab and Jupyter Notebook.


#	[Sentiment Analysis of the COVID19 Pandemic (NLP tool for analysis, R Language)](https://github.com/datascientist-kenn/Sentiment-Analysis-of-the-COVID19-Corona-Virus-Pandemic..git) 
- In a bid to understand how people all over the world are reacting to the spread of the Covid19 Pandemic, this project focuses on seeing the words that occur most in tweets from Twitter with #Covid19 hashtag with both WORD-CLOUD and Histogram visualizations and also calculates the analysis scores for both negative and positive sentiments (`Sentiment Analysis Visualized.R file`). 
- The codes are easily reproducible for calculating the sentiment analysis any Twitter hashtag.                                                                   


#	Twitter Crawler/bot (NLP tool for data cleaning, R Language)(https://github.com/datascientist-kenn/Twitter-API-Webcrawler.git) 
- Twitter is probably the best platform to crawl data from, if any organization wants to understand how the world is reacting to any new global trend. 
- So, this project intends to provide a tool that, with the availability of the API Details, the organization can collect about 18,000 of the most recent tweets in English language about any global trend and then analyse them with any tool they want.
